## About
SnatchCat communicates with the Petfinder API to return adoptable cats from shelters that is near a user.

A user can initiate a new search by entering a location (or use the current location), check the details of returned cat results, move cats to "Favorites" list, and contact shelters for more info.

Note that the email and phone link only works on physical devices but not on simulators.
